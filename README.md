# ENABLE WORDS LIST SORTED BY LENGTH

This was created for the purpose of a code-golf challenge, but if you happen upon this dictionary of words and want to use it, feel free. This is, simply put, the dictionary of "ENABLE" with expletives deleted (around 409 words removed) and a couple words added (around 109 word additions). This was the base that was used in the game "Words with Friends", which is the ENABLE dictionary with the edits mentioned.
